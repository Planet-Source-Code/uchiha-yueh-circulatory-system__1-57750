Atrium, Right.
 	The right atrium is a small upper cavity of the heart that holds about three-and-a-half tablespoons of blood.  It serves as the receiving chamber for all the venous blood (short of oxygen and laden with carbon dioxide) returning through the superior and inferior vena cava, and from many minute blood vessels that drain blood from the walls of the chamber itself.  The right atrium is slightly larger than the left atrium, which is slightly more powerful.  The walls of the right atrium are less than an eighth of an inch thick.  Two layers of muscle form the wall.  The superficial layer spans both atria, and the inner layer, composed of many small bundles, arches over the atrial cavity at right angles to the superficial layer.  As the heart contracts (ventricular systole), the blood is pushed through the pulmonary valve into pulmonary circulation.  As the heart relaxes (ventricular diastole), the blood exits the right atrium through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle.  In the upper part of the right atrium there is a small patch of special heart tissue called the sinus node or the sinoatrial node.  It is the hearts pacemaker.  It triggers the heartbeat and establishes its pace.
