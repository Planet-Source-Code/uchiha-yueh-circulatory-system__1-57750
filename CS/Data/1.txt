Aorta.
 	The body's largest blood vessel, the aorta, arches out of the heart and down toward the lower body.  It has a diameter of about one inch and blood rushes through it at a speed of about eight inches per second.  The aorta is divided into several parts: the ascending aorta, the arch of the aorta, and the thoracic and abdominal portions of the descending aorta.
