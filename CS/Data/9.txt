Great Cardiac Vein.
	 The coronary vein is often referred to as the great cardiac vein of the heart.  It is a large vein with two branches, the left coronary vein and the right coronary vein.  The vein commences at the tip (apex) of the heart and ascends along the heart to the base of the ventricles.  It then curves left to the back part of the heart and opens into the left coronary sinus, which is about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) in length and terminates in the right atrium near the inferior vena cava.
