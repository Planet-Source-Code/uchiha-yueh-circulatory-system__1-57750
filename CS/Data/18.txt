Ventricle, Left.
 	The left ventricle is the large lower cavity of the heart.  Its walls are three times thicker than those of the right ventricle, making it the most powerful chamber in the heart.  Along with the three spiral layers shared by the right ventricle (the superficial spiral layer, the deep sinospiral layer, and the superficial bulbo layer), a fourth layer of muscle, the deep bulbo spiral layer, winds from the aortic and mitral valve rings around the left ventricle and back, making the ventricle stronger to withstand higher blood pressure.  When the left ventricle contracts, the blood is pushed through the aortic semilunar valve and into the aorta.
