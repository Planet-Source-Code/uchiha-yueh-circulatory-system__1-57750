Branch of Marginal Artery.
 	The muscle that makes up the wall of the heart, the myocardium, receives oxygen-rich blood from a system of small arteries that branch from the aorta. These are called the coronary arteries.  They cross over the hearts surface, dividing and sending tiny branches into the heart muscle.  The two coronary arteries are no wider than a drinking straw.  The right coronary artery lies in a groove between the right atrium and right ventricle and loops around the lower side and to the rear of the heart like a crown.  Hence the name, coronary.  This artery supplies blood to the thick muscle of the right ventricle.  The marginal artery is a large branch of the right coronary artery.  It gives off several smaller branches which carry blood to the right atrium and ventricle.
