Middle Cardiac Vein.
 	The posterior cardiac vein is often referred to as the middle cardiac vein.  It extends from the tip (apex) of the heart, receiving blood from both ventricles, and continues along the base of the heart to the coronary sinus, where the blood is then delivered to the right atrium of the heart.
