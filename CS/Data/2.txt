Atrium, Left.
 	The left atrium is a small upper cavity of the heart.  Oxygen rich blood returns from the lungs through the four pulmonary veins into the smooth chamber of the left atrium.  The chamber is constructed of two overlapping layers of muscle: a superficial layer and an inner layer, composed of many small bundles.  The wall of the chamber is slightly thicker and more powerful than the right atrium.  As the heart contracts (ventricular systole), blood flows into the ascending aorta through the aortic arch.  As the heart relaxes (ventricle diastole), the blood flows through the mitral valve to the left ventricle.
